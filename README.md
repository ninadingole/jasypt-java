#Jasypt Java

_This is a boilerplate code I created so that I can easily import it into my project work and I dont need to do a lot of googling._

I came across a situation in a project for my client for a normal webapp we store database configurations as a JNDI. But, for any kind of batch application like in _Spring_ application there wasn't any JNDI, and as we all know **it's too bad to store the passwords as a simple text file in java properties files.** So, one of my colleagues gave me a reference to this library and said this will solve the exact problem I am facing.

Therefore I thought like me there would be many others looking for same thing, so I built this repository which contains all the codes I wrote while reading the documentation of the library Jasypt.

So, use the library and enjoy coding, I will keep updating the codes but if you have any updates please feel free to fork and please push your code to the library.
